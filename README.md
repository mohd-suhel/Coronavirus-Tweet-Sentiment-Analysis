Conclusion
📄 Introduction Sentiment Analysis is the process of computationally identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text, especially in order to determine whether the writer’s attitude towards a particular topic is Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

Tweets are often useful in generating a vast amount of sentiment data upon analysis. These data are useful in understanding the opinion of the people about a variety of topics.

❓ Problem Statement We are provided with a coronavirus tweets csv file which contains more than 40000 tweets from people around the world on covid 19 and our aim is to analyze these tweets and predict the sentiment of each of the tweet by classifying them into three categories positive, negative and neutral.

🎯 Objectives: Analyze the tweets regarding COVID 19 and get insights regarding people’s sentiment.

To build a classification model to predict the sentiment of COVID-19 tweets which have been pulled from Twitter.

📖 Data Summary The dataset contained “Tweets” gathered during pandemic times. The shape of the dataset is (41157, 6). The target variable is ‘Sentiment’.

● Username : The username of the person on twitter

● Screenname : The screenname of the person on twitter

● Location : The location from where the tweet was tweeted

● TweetAt : The date of the tweet

● OriginalTweet : The tweet itself unfiltered

● Sentiment : The sentiment of the tweet our target variable

CONCLUSION

Thus we conclude our project on coronavirus Tweet Sentiment Analysis. We used 3 different classification algorithms as Logistic regression, SGD, Naive Bayes Classifier  & his Hyperparameter Technique . We started by analyzing the dataset to learn more about the variables involved.

As a part of Exploratory Data Analysis, we tried to derive different patterns in the data. For building different classification models we used the future 'OriginalTweet' and the target variable 'Sentiment'. By performing tweet cleaning, Removing stopwords, Removing punctuations and Stemming, We prepared the column 'OriginalTweet' for modelling. We applied 3 different classification models among which SGDclassidier is the best performing model. SGDclassidier with 81% (approx) and SGDClassifier on C-V has 82.5% (approx) accuracy performed well for multinomial classification.

We hope this project will be helpful for the government and NGO’S to take adequate measures in policy making and rehabilitation respectively .

Various project organizations can make profit through the production and distribution of essentials items during the pandemic by analyzing various sentiments.
